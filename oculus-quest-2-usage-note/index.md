## Facebook Account

I've heard that Facebook is evil for a few years. But I couldn't afford any other VR headsets, like
HTC Vive or Valve Index.

So I chose to compromise and signed up an account with all piracy settings turned off; I won't
**give in** any more even if they ban the account.

They paid my off to pretend that I bought the device without the ecosystem, which in fact I couldn't
get rid of.

## Developer Mode

This is the only freedom for now, I can `adb install *.apk` as a fake developer.

Official documentation: [Device Setup - Oculus Developers][0]

Log into this [page][1], create a fake *organization*. Then open Oculus app on the phone, find the
headset device, turn on *Developer Mode* in *More Settings*.

*Starting October 8, 2020, all Oculus developers will need to verify their accounts by providing a
**payment method** and/or **phone number**.* -- [Official FAQ][4]

I **gave in** my Visa card to be this god damn fake developer, shame on me.

## Beat Saber

This game is the reason I want a VR headset, it gives me an illusion that I can play rhythm game.

[This reddit discussion][2] leads me to [this post][3] of Russian steam underground forum, where I
get the `Beat Saber [1.12.2.131] patch+savefix+90Hz+CustomRes.apk` to `adb install`.
